Hello, {{ user.username }},

Someone, hopefully you, has requested to reset the password for your account of XYZ Forum Board.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.

Otherwise, follow the link below to complete the process.
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.

Thanks,
The XYZ Forum Board Team
